### Python API Integration
The system provides a simple API that allows you to initialize the FruitClassifier with a path to the trained model, then use the predict method to classify fruit images. The system returns the predicted fruit class along with confidence scores.

 üìÅ Dataset

The system is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing:
- **Total Images**: 14,100
- **Fruit Classes**: 141 different varieties
- **Categories Include**: 
  - Various apple varieties (Braeburn, Golden, Granny Smith, etc.)
  - Citrus fruits (Orange, Lemon, Lime, Grapefruit)
  - Tropical fruits (Mango, Pineapple, Papaya, etc.)
  - Berries (Strawberry, Blueberry, Raspberry)
  - Stone fruits (Peach, Plum, Cherry)
  - And many more...

 üìà Model Architecture

 CNN Architecture Flow
The system follows a hierarchical structure starting with an Input Layer that receives the fruit image, followed by multiple Convolutional Layers for feature extraction, Pooling Layers for dimensionality reduction, Feature Extraction layers for pattern recognition, Fully Connected Layers for classification logic, and finally an Output Layer that produces results for all 141 fruit classes.

 Mathematical Foundations

Image Normalization: The system normalizes input images by subtracting the minimum pixel value and dividing by the range between maximum and minimum values.

CNN Forward Pass: Each layer processes the input through weight multiplication, bias addition, and activation function application.

üìä Results

 Training Results
- Exceptional performance with minimal overfitting
- Stable training with consistent validation metrics
- Model generalizes well to unseen data
